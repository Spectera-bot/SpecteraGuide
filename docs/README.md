## The Story

Spectera, the name you know the bot by today, was not the initial name.
On April 3 2021 I made this bot with the initial name projectHITLER which was also not the name,
I was planning to name it to HITLER when the bot would be released.
And as a lazy person at the starting on the project i used [DiscordPY](https://github.com/rapptz/discord.py) on the thought i would write less code, but with lack of python skills i stepped back after a month and moved to my native language JavaScript
and rewrited the bot to [DiscordJS](https://discord.js.org/) which was a bit fun to do but as a result of lack of patience and stuff to maintain the bot, i stopped it and after two months i came back, Rewritten it with the name [Obligator](https://github.com/Spectera-Bot/Spectera) with [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com/) as the initial database with lots of commands and features.
But then i learnt [TypeScript](https://typescript-lang.org/) and wanted to make Obligator better so i made a custom handler in 1 week and then moved to [Sapphire](https://sapphire.github.io/framework/) which was a flexible framework after i knew discord.js was taking Sapphire into it after Commando's deprecation then renamed it to Spectera after a while, now Spectera uses PostgreSQL with Prisma and Sapphire with Typescript

:::tip
Spectera uses [Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) to transpile files rather than vanilla tsc
